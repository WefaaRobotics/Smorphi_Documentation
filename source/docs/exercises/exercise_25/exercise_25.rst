Steps / Description:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
#. IoT stands for the "Internet of Things." It is a network of physical objects or "things" embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies that enable them to connect and exchange data over the internet. These objects refer to everyday devices or specialized industrial machines. The main idea behind IoT is to interconnect these devices to collect and share data, which can then be analyzed and utilized for various purposes.
